# IDAssignment1
Year 1 Semester 2 ID front-end web development assignment.  
For this Web Front-End Development Assignment I decided to do a redesign of the Battlefield 2042 main page.
The remarks online for the game has not been so good recently, and the marketing for the game is not doing well enough. So I decided to do a redesign of the Battlefield 2042 to challenge the current design of the web page.
# Design Process
I came out with the design on Adobe XD based on what I felt were lacking in the previous web pages. The web pages was lacking user-interactivity feedback to the user. I started to look for elements that are redeemable in the previous web pages such as font design and colours. The web pages were too long so I decided to replace them with slideshows to add user-interactivity while reducing the amount the user have to scroll down to look for a section.
# Features
The pages includes glowing buttons unlike the previous buttons that slightly increase in size to tempt the user in clicking and going further into the world of Battlefield 2042. The pages also include a slide shows not only to reduce the amount of scrolling but also navigation through the web pages.
#Technologies Used
The technology used are plain and simple html, css and javascript.
# Testing
I have made sure that I went through all the options for the menu bar and ways to interact with the user interface. The javascript code that I used was tested by clicking through the slides while checking the console for any mistakes in the assignment or arimethic of the global variables.
# Credits
I cannot have done without using EA resources found on the actual web pages.
